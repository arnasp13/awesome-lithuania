# Terminology

## **GitHub**

#### **Issue**

Issue can be a task, enhancement, and bug. There are templates that must be used for each of the listed issue types.

#### Labels

Labels are a great way to organize different types of issues. Issues can have as many labels as you want, and you can filter by one or many labels at once.

#### References

Often times issues are dependent on other issues, or at least relate to them and you’d like to connect the two. You can reference issues by typing in a hashtag plus the issue number.

> Hey @adtm, I think the problem started in \#199

Furthermore, by prefacing your commits with “Fixes”, “Fixed”, “Fix”, “Closes”, “Closed”, or “Close” when the commit is merged into main, it will also automatically close the issue.

## Awesome-Lithuania

#### Awesome

We love using the word 'Awesome' because it means corresponds to the era of awesomeness. Just search in GitHub and you will find more than 77k repositories that have 'awesome' word in its title.

#### Lithuania

The project is supposed to collect information about situation in Lithuania, but this does not limit us to only Lithuanians as the language of the project is in all cases - English.

#### Contribution

Anything that helps the project to move forward - requests, bug fixes, money.
