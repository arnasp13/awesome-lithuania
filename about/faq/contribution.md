## Rules

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process!

Our goal is to have the information that is credible and trustworthy. Do not upload articles, upload seperate subjects and you must be guaranteed that information is not false.

{% hint style="info" %}
 All content \(PRs, comments, titles and etc.\) must be in English.
{% endhint %}

Thank you 🚀🧑‍🚀
